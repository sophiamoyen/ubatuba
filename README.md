This repository contains a compilation of code developed for automatic detection of onset of seizures from EEG signals.
Several techniques were tested and stored in each folder. The best one until now was using sliding windows (Epochs) and a CNN for classification using `pytorch`, which is the one corresponding to the `train.py`and `predict.py`in the main folder.

Other methods used were:

- `9_Featires`: Prediction of seizure using 9 statistical features were extracted from the raw signal from 3 or 6 montages (Mean, Minimum, Maximum, Skewness, Kurtosis, Standard Deviation, Spectral Entropy and Line Length), based on (Siddiqui et. al., 2019 [1]). Then the best features are selected using Mutual Information Gain and fed to a XGBoost Classifier.

- `Wavelet_CNN`: Prediction of seizure using sliding windows (Epochs), based on (Tzimourta et. al., 2019 [2]) and (Bairagi et. al., 2021 [6]), Continous Wavelet Transform (CWT) with the wavelet type Daubechies of order 4, then the scaleogram of the signals are fed into a CNN for prediction of seizure, based on (Mao et. al., 2020 [3]) and [5], for each Epoch and reanalysed as a whole signal for onset detection.

- `DWT_ll`: Prediction of seizure using sliding windows (Epochs), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with the wavelet type Daubechies of order 4, based on (Guo et. al., 2010 [4]), then the output coefficients are fed into a Random Forest Classifier for prediction of seizure for each Epoch and reanalysed as a whole signal for onset detection.

Usage:

```
python train.py
python predict_pretrained.py --test_dir ../test/
python score.py --test_dir ../test/
```
